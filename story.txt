Her sister, her mom, and her grandma were witches. When she was 
16, she learned her first spell. She picked up her wand and said an
incantation, and she accidentally turned herself into a puppy. The change
scared her. She started to find the way can recover to human. She read all the
spell books but there are no spell can treat her. She tried to ask her mom, sister, 
and grandma for help. However, they all didn't memtion this cute puppy is she 
but nagged why she was disappered without doing her laundry. They were not worried
at all that this cute puppy could have been her, but rather why her dirty clothes
littered the floor of her room. They took this cute puppy, which she was stuck inside
of, to the animal shelter where she would be trapped in a cage for the rest of her life.
